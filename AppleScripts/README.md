# AppleScripts

Here are a few useful AppleScripts that I have written. Installation instructions are below.

## Installation

#### Pre-compiled

Browse to the `scripts/AppleScripts/precompiled` directory. Here you will find the same AppleScript files that you see in `scripts/AppleScripts`, except these files have already been compiled down into `.scpt` files.

You may run these scripts as is using the AppleScript Editor application. Alternatively, you may also run these scripts through the Terminal, with the help of the `osascript` command (usage: `osascript /path/to/file.scpt`).

#### Manually-compiled

At the root level of the `scripts/AppleScripts` folder, you will find multiple `.applescript` files. These are the un-complied, plain text versions of my AppleScripts, which you can open in any text editor to begin playing with the code.

To compile and run these .applescript files, type `osacompile /path/to/file.applescript` into the Terminal, followed by `osascript /path/to/compiled-file.scpt` (output is usually written to `a.scpt` unless otherwise specified).

## Credits

These AppleScripts were authored by __Jordan Saints__ for the betterment of general know-how. Anyone may use them for whatever purpose they like. I hope you find them useful! :)
